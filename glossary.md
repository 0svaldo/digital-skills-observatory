At the end of the study, we shall compare the differences between the two groups and make conclusions on whether we think the workshops had any effect or not.
* __User-centred design__: User requirements are considered right from the beginning and included into the whole product cycle. These requirements are noted and refined through investigative methods including: ethnographic study, contextual inquiry, prototype testing, usability testing and other methods.

For our case it is the group that will have all the requirement for the research but no training (intervention/treatment) will be conducted for them but we will only follow up with questions to see how they progress with phone usage and DFS.
* __Curriculum__: This is the course work that will be used to train one group of the first time smartphone users.
* __Hypothesis__: This is the proposition or propositions that shall be made before the research on the ground commences. This proposition shall be weighed against the actual findings after the research to see if it is indeed true or otherwise.
