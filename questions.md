### Research questions driving this project
1. What are the immediate barriers to usage for first time smartphone users?
2. How does limited literacy impact the usage and adoption?
3. What formal and active education methods including training programs and outreach increase adoption?
4. What informal and passive education methods including pre-loaded applications, improved device on-boarding, and improved user experience increase adoption?
5. Does improved digital literacy and smartphone adoption change expectations for financial stability?
6. Since most people buying a smartphone today have never used the Internet, they may have no prior concept of the web, or search. Do new users understand the application metaphor? How do they discover new applications? How does this shape their understanding and use of DFS?
7. Most people get help using their new phones – from whom and for what? What other help might be appropriate or more helpful?
8. What spelling, syntax and language do they use online. Are text contractions, emoticons etc. standardized? Do people use sheng (mixture of Swahili and English) and if so for what communications?
9. Who purchased the phone? Was it purchased on credit? Many phones are gifts, especially from boyfriends, parents and urban relatives – how does this influence full adoption and use of the phones and DFS?
10. Who else uses the phone and for what purpose? Our general hypothesis is that smartphones are private and personal, but are there use case exceptions?
11. What is the route to discovery of uses outside of social media e.g. do people discover the web via links they receive in social media?
12. Are digital skills more / less / equally important than financial skills when it comes to the adoption of DFS? i.e. digital literacy vs. financial literacy
13. Does gender have an effect in the use of different applications in smartphones?
