# Research questions driving this project

### Adoption  
1. Who else uses the phone and for what purpose? Our general hypothesis is that smartphones are private and personal, but are there use case exceptions? What are the consequences on the usage of DFS?
2. What is the route to discovery of DFS? What are the different channels?
3. Are entertainment and social media interesting vehicules for learning and adopting DFS?
4. Is there a difference between the way men and women use DFS? What are the consequences of these differences?

### Skills
5. Are digital skills more / less / equally important than financial skills when it comes to the adoption of DFS? i.e. digital literacy vs. financial literacy
6. Does improved digital literacy and smartphone adoption change expectations for financial stability?
7. Do new users understand the application metaphor? How do they discover new applications? How does this shape their understanding and use of DFS?
8. Is there a difference between men and women in the way they learn and apply their new digital skills?

### Education methods
9. What mediated / non-mediated education methods including pre-loaded applications, improved device on-boarding, and improved user experience increase adoption of DFS? (social learning / on device learning)
10. What informal and passive education methods including pre-loaded applications, improved device on-boarding, and improved user experience increase adoption of DFS?
11. Most people get help using their new phones. From whom and for what? What other help might be appropriate or more helpful?

### Design
12. Products & services How does colloquial/local/online language (e.g. Sheng, emoticons) influence use of services that relate to DFS (e.g. games with monetization built in)?
